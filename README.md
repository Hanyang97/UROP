# UROP

This is the UROP I have done in 2021 summer.
Functions can be found in utils.py. Models can be found in model.py. Tokeniser can be found in tokenizer.py.

There are three groups of ipynbs. In each group, 1000 represents split of 100:0. 9010 represents split of 90:10.
The first group is clustering purely based on number of initial commands chosen.
The second group is clustering based on previously unclustered clusters. 
The third group is clustering within each previous cluster first, then cluster all clusters.
Table.ipynb contains code to produce results for report.
